Regarding data analystics and literacy, I agree that there is a need to make sure that the results of analytics are easily interpreted by the individuals who will be making use of the data. Data scientists need to make sure that those they work with are able to understand what the results of analytics solutions (like statistical modeling and machine learning) actually mean. 

This was an interesting example of illustrating ways in which the healthcare industry needs to follow the leads of other industries, like the airline industry. Physicians, for instance, often have to interpret data on their own. This is where the possibilities of biomedical informatics really comes in; biomedical informatics can help to reduce the burden on physicians and help them cope with the ever-increasing demand on cognitive resources.
